# rock-paper-scissors

This is part of The Odin Project. I am beginning with the simple program of Rock Paper Scissors, then eventually I will create a UI for it. I believe the hard part will be the UI rather than the program. I have done things like this before. What worries me is the CSS.


Took me a while to get this done. Tried to include arrays to decide winning combination for player, but couldn't figure it out, so I went with simple stacked if and else ifs. Whatever, not sophisticated (yet!), but it works.


After I read the instructions, I realized I needed to include returns in the functions. I kept the old code commented out at the bottom. I also used local variables only. I guess these are good JS practices.

I have added a UI to this project. I am still yet to add the functionality that keeps track of your game score and determines a winner based on the best of 5 games.
