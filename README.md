# rock-paper-scissors

This is part of The Odin Project. I am beginning with the simple program of Rock Paper Scissors, then eventually I will create a UI for it. I believe the hard part will be the UI rather than the program. I have done things like this before. What worries me is the CSS.


Took me a while to get this done. Tried to include arrays to decide winning combination for player, but couldn't figure it out, so I went with simple stacked if and else ifs. Whatever, not sophisticated (yet!), but it works.
